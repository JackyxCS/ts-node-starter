A TypeScript Node.js Starter

### Testing
- npm install
- create a .env file with your ARIZE_API_KEY="your_api_key" in ts-node-starter
- test the client in src/index.ts - explore the available functions using intelliSense and call each function to test its functionality. The list of available function is also available in the doc.
- npm run dev or tsx src/index.ts when you want to run index.ts to see output
- record any issues
